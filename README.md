## About the Book
TinyML, or Tiny Machine Learning, is used to enable machine learning on resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. If you want to leverage these low-cost, low-power but strangely powerful devices, then this book is for you.

This book aims to increase accessibility to TinyML applications, particularly for professionals who lack the resources or expertise to develop and deploy them on microcontroller-based boards. The book starts by giving a brief introduction to Artificial Intelligence, including classical methods for solving complex problems. It also familiarizes you with the different ML model development and deployment tools, libraries, and frameworks suitable for embedded devices and microcontrollers. The book will then help you build an Air gesture digit recognition system using the Arduino Nano RP2040 board and an AI project for recognizing keywords using the Syntiant TinyML board. Lastly, the book summarizes the concepts covered and provides a brief introduction to topics such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning, federated learning, and MLOps.

By the end of the book, you will be able to develop and deploy end-to-end Tiny ML solutions with ease.
